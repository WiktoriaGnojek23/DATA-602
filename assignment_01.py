#The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles and prints to the user the area of both rectangles. 

''' define the length and width of both rectangles'''
''' I added int infront of input function because since when I initially ran it without I got 
this error; can't multiply sequence by non-int of type str'''

''' print output'''
