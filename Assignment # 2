Q1;
What will the following code display?
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:-5])
Can you debug and fix the output? The code should return the entire list
'''
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0:5])

'''
We have to begin from zero as that is the starting index, and end after the final index to display
the whole list.

Q2. Design a program that asks the user to enter a store’s sales for each day of the
week. The amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for
the week and display the result.
'''

monday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
tuesday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
wednesday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
thursday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
friday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
saturday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
sunday = int(input('Enter the store sales for today: '))
store_sales = [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday]
print(sum(store_sales))

Q3. Create a list with at least 5 places you’d like to travel to. Make sure the list isn’t in
alphabetical order
● Print your list in its original order.
● Use the sort() function to arrange your list in order and reprint your list.
● Use the sort(reverse=True) and reprint your list.

'''
travel = ['greece', 'japan', 'spain', 'russia', 'australia']
print(travel)

travel.sort()
print(travel)

travel.reverse()
print(travel)

Q4. Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room
numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The program should also create a
dictionary containing course numbers and the names of the instructors that teach each
course. After that, the program should let the user enter a course number, then it should
display the course’s room number, instructor, and meeting time.
'''
course_number = {'A34': 101, 'B67': 876, 'C78': 502}
instructor_name = {'A34': 'George', 'B67': 'Kyle', 'C78': 'Sandy'}
meeting_time = {'A34': 9, 'B67': 10, 'C78': 1}


course_info = input('Enter course number: ')
if course_info not in course_number: print(course_info, 'is an invalid course number.') 
else: 
    print(course_info) 
    print('Room:', course_number[course_info], 
          'Instructor:', instructor_name[course_info],
          'Meeting Time:', meeting_time[course_info]) 
    
'''
Q5. Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as
key-value pairs. The program should then demonstrate the four options:
● look up a person’s email address,
● add a new name and email address,
● change an existing email address, and
● delete an existing name and email address.
